Hello reader! We here at Rovel Blog, try to provide you the best sections for tutorials, reviews, introductions, and upcoming secret NEWS™ from our company!

## What's here for you?

This blog was created because we thought that we couldn't give our own reviews, tutorials on discord, so we thought of creating our own blog. We didn't choose **Medium™** because they had a kind of competition between their bloggers, and much more, all their stuff wasn't free to read for normal-free readers.

So we decided to create our own Blog, with Medium ™ like interface for easy viewing, and provide better news and blogs without interacting with third party company like Medium™.

## Can I apply for Blogging?

Sure, we are always looking for bloggers, who want to blog on these topics:-
- Gaming
- Computer Science
- Reviews on game/software/website/device
- Programming tutorials
- And lastly, for Rovel stuff

If you want to blog on the topics listed above, either contact Rovel team from [our email](support@rovelstars.ga) or from our [discord server](https://discord.gg/Rf3xPMm)

Let's see you as a Blogger™ *soon*!
